- Include test cases in problem files

## Problem Solving Workflow
1. Create new problem file using the template
2. Understand the problem and identify patterns
3. Plan approach with pseudocode if needed
4. Implement solution with proper error handling
5. Test with example cases
6. Analyze time and space complexity
7. Git commit with descriptive message
